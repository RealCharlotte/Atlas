  <b>Atlas</b> adds the ability to switch game profiles in the same manner you could do so on old games, such as Pok√©mon. Game saves include all information and can be switched at the click of a button!
  </br> </br>
  <b>All</b> game save data is unique to said game save thus each game save includes it's own <code>Ender Chest</code>, <code>Active Potions</code>, <code>Hunger Level</code>, <code>Health Level</code>, <code>Inventory</code> and much more. It's almost like playing on an alt, without switching to another account.
